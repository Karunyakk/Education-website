<h1>Political parties</h1>
<p>Every political party in India - whether a national or regional/state party - must have a symbol and must be registered with the Election Commission of India. Symbols are used in the Indian political system to identify political parties in part so that illiterate people can vote by recognizing the party symbols.

In the current amendment to the Symbols Order, the Commission has asserted the following five principles:

    A party, National or State, must have a legislative presence.
    A National party's legislative presence must be in the Lok Sabha. A State party's legislative presence must be in the State Assembly.
    A party can set up a candidate only from amongst its own members.
    A party that loses its recognition shall not lose its symbol immediately but shall be allowed to use that symbol for some time to try and retrieve its status. (However, the grant of such facility to the party will not mean the extension of other facilities to it, as are available to recognized parties, such as free time on Doordarshan or AIR, free supply of copies of electoral rolls, etc.)
    Recognition should be given to a party only on the basis of its own performance in elections and not because it is a splinter group of some other recognized party.</p>
